Her tenure ended four days later, before Altman returned to the company. But now Murati is a CEO again, this time at her own stealthy startup. The firm is coy about what it's working on beyond a focus on science and programming AI. Even minus specifics, the buzz is deafening thanks almost entirely to Murati's reputation: Without revenue, without a product, without a fully defined category, it's said to be planning to raise $1 billion at a valuation of around $9 billion.
