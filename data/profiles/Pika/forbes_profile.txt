Stanford Ph.D. students Demi Guo and Chenlin Meng cofounded the startup in 2023 after growing frustrated with the quality of AI video generation tools, but they now compete in a cluttered market. Pika, which recently launched a feature that allows users to take a selfie with an AI generated version of their younger self, has been used to create 58 million videos. Since its launch, the startup has raised a total of $135 million in funding at a $470 million valuation according to PitchBook and has been backed by angel investors like former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman and Quora cofounder and CEO Adam D'Angelo.

"Because of these two passions, I was always very excited to do something at the intersection of AI and creative stuff," she says. Her interests came together in 2023 when she cofounded Pika with fellow Stanford Ph.D. student Chenlin Meng, 27. The AI tool turns written prompts into cinematic videos in a plethora of styles including realistic live action, computer animation and anime. The startup has raised $135 million from investors, including former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman, at a reported valuation of nearly $470 million. This sort of tech has become a hot-button topic amid concerns that AI will threaten showbiz jobs (a central issue in the Hollywood writers' strike in 2023). Guo argues Pika isn't out to replace human artists: "The human artist is the one to guide AI in the right direction and eventually become a masterpiece," she says.ByKirsten TaggartForbes StaffWATCHOct 8, 2024Meta Movie Gen To Change Social Media: Who Defines Who You AreZuckerberg said Meta AI had nearly 500 million users.
