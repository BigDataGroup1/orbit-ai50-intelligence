Read MoreProductivity doesn’t have to be all work and no play–at least, not according to Ivan Zhao, Simon Last and Akshay Kothari, cofounders of Notion. The company created collaborative workplace software where people can brainstorm, organize and gamify their goals and work habits. Major companies like OpenAI, Figma and Toyota use the software, but it has also found popularity among Gen Z after videos of people using Notion to make weekly schedules went viral on TikTok in 2021. The influx of users from the popular app was so great that it crashed the startup’s servers. Valued at $10 billion, Notion has raised a total of $330 million from the likes of Coatue, Sequoia Capital and Index Ventures and it surpassed 100 million users last year. Aside from the free plan, Notion charges upwards of $10 per month for users to access AI features that include writing and summarizing text.
