Read MoreAnyone who has ever selected the number of bicycles in an image to “prove your humanity” knows that deciphering a photo is an especially tricky task for machines. Enter Coactive AI, which builds a set of pre-trained AI models that can parse through large amounts of raw visual data without relying on a human to identify more than a couple of examples. One real world application is content moderation: Coactive can sort prohibited and accepted images and video automatically. Companies have also used it to make sense of mountains of photo assets. Led by Cody Coleman, a computer science alum from both Stanford and MIT, Coactive AI has raised $44 million in funding, reaching a valuation of $200 million after its Series B in May 2024. It's also been selected as one of Forbes' next billion-dollar startups.
