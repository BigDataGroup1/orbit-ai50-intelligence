Speak wants to change that by offering an AI tutor for users to converse with, helping them achieve fluency in English and Spanish. In December of 2024, its valuation doubled to $1 billion, after raising $78 million from OpenAI, Khosla Ventures and Y Combinator. Its founders are certainly fluent in entrepreneurship: CEO Connor Zwick previously founded video game company Coco Controller as a Harvard dropout-turned-member of the Thiel Fellowship.

Speak cofounder and CTO Andrew Hsu also dropped out of his Stanford neuroscience PhD program to be an inaugural member of the Thiel Fellowship and pursue his ed-tech startup Airy Labs.
