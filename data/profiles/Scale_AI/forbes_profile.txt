Cofounders Alexandr Wang and Lucy Guo had realized humans were vital in labeling the data needed to train the AI used in self-driving cars. Scale capitalized on that boom, setting itself up as a crucial data supplier for generative AI. Nearly a decade later, it works with customers like Meta, Microsoft and OpenAI on labeling training data and building infrastructure for their models. It was last valued at $13.8 billion in May after closing a $1 billion series F funding round backed by Accel, Amazon, Meta and others, cementing Wang's status as one of the world's youngest billionaires at age 28. In March, Scale AI announced a contract with the Department of Defense called Thunderforge to help it use AI for military planning and operations.
