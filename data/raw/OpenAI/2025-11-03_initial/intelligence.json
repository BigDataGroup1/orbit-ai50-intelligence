    "description": "OpenAI is running up against the clock. The ChatGPT maker has until the end of the year to complete a complicated transition from a non-profit to a for-profit entity in order to get its hands on a majority of its late March $40 billion funding round\u2013the largest private tech fundraise to date. The restructuring has been challenged by former cofounder-turned-rival Elon Musk, who has asked authorities to block the transition and at one point offered to buy the nonprofit that controls OpenAI. But the $300 billion-valued behemoth continues to grow: 500 million people now use conversational bot ChatGPT weekly and it has some 2 million paying enterprise users. In March, the AI juggernaut added more advanced image generation capabilities to ChatGPT, setting off a viral and controversial trend where people created thousands of images in the style of Japanese animator Studio Ghibli, whose cofounder Hayao Miyazaki famously called AI-generated art \u201can insult to life itself.\u201d",
