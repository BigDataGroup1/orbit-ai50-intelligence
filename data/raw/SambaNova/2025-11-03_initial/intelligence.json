    "description": "SambaNova is one of a number of companies vying to build the next generation of AI chips. The competition is fierce, pitting the eight-year-old startup against both legacy players like Nvidia as well as rival startups like Groq and Cerebras. SambaNova's edge comes from its focus on combining software with hardware to develop products focused specifically on AI computations and data processing for companies like Aramco, Softbank and Hugging Face. It helps that the company's cofounders include Stanford professors CTO Kunle Olukotun and Christopher R\u00e9, along with CEO Rodrigo Liang, a former longtime senior vice president at Oracle. Since they founded SambaNova in 2017 it has raised $1.1 billion in investment from backers like Accel, OpenAI and Khosla Ventures and is valued at $5.1 billion.",
