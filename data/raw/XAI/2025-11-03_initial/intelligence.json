    "description": "Elon Musk's artificial intelligence company xAI claims its mission is to \u201cunderstand the true nature of the universe\u201d and \u201caccelerate human scientific discovery.\u201d In late March, the company made a notable acquisition: scooping up X (formerly Twitter) in an all-stock deal that valued the social media platform at $33 billion and the newly merged company at $80 billion. Musk, the world's richest person, owns both entities and said the deal would involve merging their data, models and talent. In June, xAI started building a massive datacenter in Memphis called Colossus that supports a cluster of 100,000 GPUs to train future xAI models. Three months later, part of the supercomputer was online. Not everyone in the city is thrilled about that: Forbes has reported that community members and environment advocates have criticized the speed and secrecy with which the facility was built.",
