    "description": "Practicing cardiologist Dr. Shiv Rao founded Abridge in 2018 to free clinicians from the time-sucking paperwork that's required after they see patients: jotting down detailed notes for their medical records. Instead, Abridge records their conversations with patients and uses AI to both summarize them and fill out electronic health forms. Thousands of clinicians at health systems like John Hopkins Medicine and Mayo Clinic are already using it. In June, the startup announced a $300 million series E funding round supported by Andreessen Horowitz and Khosla Ventures, bumping its valuation to $5.3 billion.",
