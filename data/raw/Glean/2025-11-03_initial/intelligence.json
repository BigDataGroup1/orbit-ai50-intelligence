The AI-powered search tool\u2014used by over 1 million employees on teams at companies like Booking.com, Deutsche Telekom and Duolingo\u2014is trained on a company's entire database, allowing employees to get quick access to their pressing questions by pinging customizable AI agents in Slack, Teams and Zendesk. In February, the unicorn company claimed it had $100 million in annualized revenue, and in June, the company secured $150 million in a Series F funding round led by Wellington Management\u2014upping its valuation to $7.2 billion. Glean Agents, which the company introduced in May, allows employees to create and scale agents without coding.",
