    "description": "Online influencers can help companies boost sales \u2014 but hiring a human to promote your product involves contracts, usage rights and, of course, payments. Captions, a generative video editing and creating company led by CEO and cofounder Gaurav Misra, allows brands to create realistic human-looking \u201cAI brand avatars\u201d that can generate quick ads and social media posts, complete with AI-generated voiceovers based on a provided script. The concept has attracted heavyweight investors including Kleiner Perkins, Sequoia Capital, and Andreessen Horowitz, which participated in a $60 million Series C funding round last fall that netted the company a $500 million valuation.",
