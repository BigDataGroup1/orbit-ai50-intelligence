    "description": "Sierra is the latest act for its CEO Bret Taylor, the OpenAI board member who was formerly Facebook CTO, Salesforce co-CEO and Twitter chairman. He started the company in 2023 with longtime Google veteran Clay Bavor with the belief that ChatGPT-style conversational AI agents would transform the way businesses interact with their customers. Those include text chats as well as voice agents, who can talk people through flight changes, shopping returns or banking questions. Traction from customers including Sonos and The North Face has helped Taylor and Bavor to raise $285 million from top VC firms Benchmark and Sequoia, reaching a $4.5 billion valuation last fall. In September, the company announced they've raised another $350 million at a valuation of $10 billion, led by Greenoaks.",
