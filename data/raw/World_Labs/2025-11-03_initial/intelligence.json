    "description": "World Labs founder and CEO Fei-Fei Li has AI bona fides in spades: A pioneer in computer vision, the former head of AI for Google Cloud (and AI advisor to California Governor Gavin Newsom) is known in the industry as \u201cthe Godmother of AI.\u201d Her latest venture, which she founded while working at Stanford's Institute for Human-Centered AI, develops AI models that analyze the physical world and generate artificial environments for people to roam and explore as in a video game. It could be useful for things like creating theme park attractions or flight training simulations, and Li has a murderers' row of Silicon Valley investors backing her, including Andreessen Horowitz, Marc Benioff and Reid Hoffman.",
