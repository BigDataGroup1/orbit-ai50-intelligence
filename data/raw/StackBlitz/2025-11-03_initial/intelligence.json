    "description": "Web development startup StackBlitz was on the verge of shuttering when it found overnight success with Bolt.new, a website-building service that integrates Anthropic\u2019s AI models to quickly spin up web pages and apps. The company claims it reached $4 million in annualized revenue within four weeks of launching in October 2024. Bolt has since expanded to offer a tool that can turn a website into a mobile app without any coding. It raised a series B in January from VC outfits including Emergence Capital and GV (Google Ventures), which brought its total funding to $105 million and boosted it to a $700 million valuation.",
