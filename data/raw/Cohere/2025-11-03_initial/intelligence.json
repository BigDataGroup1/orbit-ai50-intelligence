    "description": "Cohere focuses on creating language models for AI research as well as enterprise applications. In fact, cofounder and CEO Aidan Gomez was one of the coauthors of a key research paper that sparked the development of generative AI. He and cofounders Nick Frosst and Ivan Zhang have deep ties to Google Brain, where Gomez and Frosst worked under famed technologist Geoffrey Hinton in Toronto while Zhang was known to come by to hang out after work. Cohere has since become an industry darling, reaching a $5.5 billion valuation from backers including Salesforce and Nvidia. But not everyone is impressed. In February, Forbes and a group of publishers including The Atlantic and Vox sued Cohere for alleged copyright and trademark violation. Cohere has denied the allegations, calling the suit \u201cmisguided and frivolous.\u201d",
