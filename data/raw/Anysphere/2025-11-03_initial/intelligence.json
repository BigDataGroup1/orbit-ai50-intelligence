    "description": "AI coding tool Cursor is among the hottest products in a very hot AI market. It\u2019s the only product of parent company Anysphere, which is growing superfast; it\u2019s said to have signed $100 million in contracts in about a year \u2014 a figure that has since reportedly doubled. Founded in 2022 by 24-year-old Michael Truell and three MIT classmates, Cursor helps engineers from companies including Instacart and Samsung edit code with nontechnical prompts in everyday language that can be as simple as \u201cmake me an 8-bit side-scroller video game\u201d or \u201cbuild me a weather app.\u201d They\u2019re already taking on giants like Github Copilot in the global market for automated coding, which is expected to reach $30 billion by 2032. \u201cThe ambition of the company is to completely change how people build software,\u201d Truell says.",
