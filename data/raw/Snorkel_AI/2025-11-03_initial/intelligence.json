    "description": "Born out of Stanford University's Artificial Intelligence Lab in 2019, Snorkel AI sells software products that allow businesses to annotate, fine-tune and label their data. The company reached a valuation of more than $1 billion after picking up $85 million in a series C in 2021, bringing its total investment to over $135 million. The company's tools have become a go-to for large companies like Google and furniture retailer Wayfair as well as several of the biggest American banks. In October 2024, the company added a slew of new capabilities for one of its flagship products, Snorkel Flow, including tools to assess the performance of an LLM and more easily extract information from PDFs.",
