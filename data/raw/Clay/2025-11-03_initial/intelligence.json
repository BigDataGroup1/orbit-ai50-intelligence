    "description": "Kareem Amin has a unique background for a tech founder: He once worked in journalism. Before starting Clay, a $3.1 billion unicorn that makes AI-powered spreadsheets for sales teams, he was the vice president of product for the Wall Street Journal, where he developed software that let reporters publish data-driven articles on mobile phones. \u201cI was really interested in building tools for programming for non-programmers,\u201d Amin says. \u201cIn that case, it was journalists.\u201d Now the target is businesses both large and small. Corporate clients OpenAI and Anthropic use Clay to organize sales leads and suss out new ones. A protein-shake vendor, say, could use its software to pull location, phone numbers and user ratings on gyms across the country.",
