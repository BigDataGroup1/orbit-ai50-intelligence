    "description": "Even Suno admits its technology could be a threat to the status quo of the music industry. The AI music and sound generation startup has caused a stir since its founding in 2022 by CEO Mikey Shulman\u2014a self-described \u201cformer mediocre musician,\u201d MIT lecturer and former head of machine learning at S&P Global subsidiary Kensho. Suno uses artificial intelligence to let users create full songs with lyrics and background music from basic text-based prompts. In June, major record labels including Sony and Warner sued the startup for allegedly copying thousands of their songs to train its AI models. The music generator has surprisingly admitted its software is trained on all the music files openly available on the internet, arguing that doing so is fair use. But the legal snafu hasn't dampened investors' interest. The Cambridge-based startup has scooped up $125 million in funding from investors like Lightspeed Venture Partners and GitHub CEO Nat Friedman and has grown to around 12 million users. Valued at $500 million, per Pitchbook, Suno integrated with Amazon's Alexa earlier this year.",
