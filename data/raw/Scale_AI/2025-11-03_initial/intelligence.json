    "description": "Scale AI was conceived in 2016 as a one-stop shop for supplying human labor to perform tasks that could not be done by algorithms \u2014 essentially, the antithesis of AI. Cofounders Alexandr Wang and Lucy Guo had realized humans were vital in labeling the data needed to train the AI used in self-driving cars. Scale capitalized on that boom, setting itself up as a crucial data supplier for generative AI. Nearly a decade later, it works with customers like Meta, Microsoft and OpenAI on labeling training data and building infrastructure for their models. It was last valued at $13.8 billion in May after closing a $1 billion series F funding round backed by Accel, Amazon, Meta and others, cementing Wang's status as one of the world's youngest billionaires at age 28. In March, Scale AI announced a contract with the Department of Defense called Thunderforge to help it use AI for military planning and operations.",
