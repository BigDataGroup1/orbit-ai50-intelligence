    "description": "AI companies that were once constrained by the supply of advanced Nvidia chips face a new roadblock: power. Systems like ChatGPT consume tons of electricity, enough for tens of thousands of homes. Enter Crusoe Energy. The $2.8 billion-valued company has a knack for finding untapped energy sources in remote places like North Dakota and Iceland and building datacenters to power compute-heavy tasks, starting with cryptocurrency mining and now running and training AI models. The startup is building one of the largest datacenters in the world in Abilene, Texas as the lead developer of the first site of Project Stargate\u2014 the $500 billion AI infrastructure joint initiative backed by OpenAI, SoftBank, Oracle and MGX. CEO Chase Lochmiller, who summited Mount Everest before starting Crusoe in 2018, says \u201cwe're building the factory of factories.\u201d",
