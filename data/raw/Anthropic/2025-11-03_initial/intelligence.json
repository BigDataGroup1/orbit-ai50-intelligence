    "description": "Anthropic has climbed to No. 2 on this year's Cloud 100 list. Anthropic has continued to be the OpenAI challenger with the most staying power. In February, it released a \u201chybrid reasoning\u201d model called Claude 3.7 Sonnet that can automatically decide how to approach a question\u2014either taking time to process it by breaking it down to smaller chunks or answering it quickly in real time. The company has also pushed into software development, releasing Claude Code, an AI system that can search and read code, edit files and run commands among a slew of other software engineering functions. CEO Dario Amodei has said that in about a year, all code might be written by AI. Most recently, Anthropic paired up with Databricks, another Cloud 100 lister, to sell AI agents\u2014software that can autonomously carry out specific tasks\u2014to thousands of enterprise customers. In March, Anthropic nabbed $3.5 billion in a Series E funding round led by Lightspeed Venture Partners with a post-money valuation of $61.5 billion. The company released a new Claude Opus model in August, and in July, the US Department of Defense awarded Anthropic a contract of up to $200 million to work on AI capabilities that further US national security. In September, the company secured another $13 billion in a Series F funding round led by ICONIQ at a $183 billion post-money valuation.",
