        "description": "Practicing cardiologist Dr. Shiv Rao founded Abridge in 2018 to free clinicians from the time-sucking paperwork that's required after they see patients: jotting down detailed notes for their medical records. Instead, Abridge records their conversations with patients and uses AI to both summarize them and fill out electronic health forms. Thousands of clinicians at health systems like John Hopkins Medicine and Mayo Clinic are already using it. In June, the startup announced a $300 million series E funding round supported by Andreessen Horowitz and Khosla Ventures, bumping its valuation to $5.3 billion.",

In February, it released a \u201chybrid reasoning\u201d model called Claude 3.7 Sonnet that can automatically decide how to approach a question\u2014either taking time to process it by breaking it down to smaller chunks or answering it quickly in real time. The company has also pushed into software development, releasing Claude Code, an AI system that can search and read code, edit files and run commands among a slew of other software engineering functions. CEO Dario Amodei has said that in about a year, all code might be written by AI. Most recently, Anthropic paired up with Databricks, another Cloud 100 lister, to sell AI agents\u2014software that can autonomously carry out specific tasks\u2014to thousands of enterprise customers. In March, Anthropic nabbed $3.5 billion in a Series E funding round led by Lightspeed Venture Partners with a post-money valuation of $61.5 billion. The company released a new Claude Opus model in August, and in July, the US Department of Defense awarded Anthropic a contract of up to $200 million to work on AI capabilities that further US national security. In September, the company secured another $13 billion in a Series F funding round led by ICONIQ at a $183 billion post-money valuation.",

That's Baseten's sweet spot. The company has developed a cloud that uses software tricks to make inference faster; CEO and cofounder Tuhin Srivastava claims some clients switching from competitors see inference costs fall up to 65%, with better performance to boot. Baseten scored a $75 million boost of funding in February, valuing it at $850 million, and Srivastava sees infinite promise: \u201cYou train once, you infer forever.\u201d",

Enter Coactive AI, which builds a set of pre-trained AI models that can parse through large amounts of raw visual data without relying on a human to identify more than a couple of examples. One real world application is content moderation: Coactive can sort prohibited and accepted images and video automatically. Companies have also used it to make sense of mountains of photo assets. Led by Cody Coleman, a computer science alum from both Stanford and MIT, Coactive AI has raised $44 million in funding, reaching a valuation of $200 million after its Series B in May 2024. It's also been selected as one of Forbes' next billion-dollar startups.",

He and cofounders Nick Frosst and Ivan Zhang have deep ties to Google Brain, where Gomez and Frosst worked under famed technologist Geoffrey Hinton in Toronto while Zhang was known to come by to hang out after work. Cohere has since become an industry darling, reaching a $5.5 billion valuation from backers including Salesforce and Nvidia. But not everyone is impressed. In February, Forbes and a group of publishers including The Atlantic and Vox sued Cohere for alleged copyright and trademark violation.

The startup's pitch to corporate clients, which include public companies like Duolingo and Hertz alongside buzzy startups such as Notion and Rippling, is that its AI can help consumers return products, cancel subscriptions or order replacement credit cards. Zhang says his secret sauce is that Decagon's bots can appear to empathize with frustrated users\u2014which is more than can be said of the average call center employee. \u201cWe give a very, very personalized experience.\u201d",

DeepL's free basic service has been used by millions of people, and it claims to have more than 200,000 business users, including Zendesk, Coursera and Klarna. In May 2024, the Cologne, Germany-based company cracked a $2 billion valuation.

The generative AI audio company has 45 pre-made voices for dubbing podcasts, narrating audiobooks and creating voiceovers. CEO Mati Staniszewski started the company with childhood friend Piotr Dabkowski in 2022 after being frustrated by poorly dubbed films. The Polish duo landed on the Forbes 30 Under 30 Europe list last year and have raised $281 million for their company at a valuation of $3.3 billion. But it has also taken heat from voice actors, who have sued the company for allegedly cloning their voices without permission (ElevenLabs has asked for the claims to be dismissed due to a lack of evidence). The software was also used to create a fake robocall that imitated Biden's voice, urging voters in New Hampshire not to vote. In response, ElevenLabs reportedly suspended the account behind the deepfake for violating its policies. In August, the company launched Eleven Music, which uses text prompts to generate songs and is available for commercial use.",

The idea is to make hiring less subjective, instead of the \u201cvery vibes-based assessment\u201d of traditional interviews, says CEO Brendan Foody. \u201cOur models are able to figure out the features on r\u00e9sum\u00e9s that are actually predictive.\u201d Foody and his cofounders, all age 21, dropped out of college to start Mercor.

The influx of users from the popular app was so great that it crashed the startup\u2019s servers. Valued at $10 billion, Notion has raised a total of $330 million from the likes of Coatue, Sequoia Capital and Index Ventures and it surpassed 100 million users last year. Aside from the free plan, Notion charges upwards of $10 per month for users to access AI features that include writing and summarizing text.",

The ChatGPT maker has until the end of the year to complete a complicated transition from a non-profit to a for-profit entity in order to get its hands on a majority of its late March $40 billion funding round\u2013the largest private tech fundraise to date. The restructuring has been challenged by former cofounder-turned-rival Elon Musk, who has asked authorities to block the transition and at one point offered to buy the nonprofit that controls OpenAI. But the $300 billion-valued behemoth continues to grow: 500 million people now use conversational bot ChatGPT weekly and it has some 2 million paying enterprise users. In March, the AI juggernaut added more advanced image generation capabilities to ChatGPT, setting off a viral and controversial trend where people created thousands of images in the style of Japanese animator Studio Ghibli, whose cofounder Hayao Miyazaki famously called AI-generated art \u201can insult to life itself.\u201d",

The competition is fierce, pitting the eight-year-old startup against both legacy players like Nvidia as well as rival startups like Groq and Cerebras. SambaNova's edge comes from its focus on combining software with hardware to develop products focused specifically on AI computations and data processing for companies like Aramco, Softbank and Hugging Face. It helps that the company's cofounders include Stanford professors CTO Kunle Olukotun and Christopher R\u00e9, along with CEO Rodrigo Liang, a former longtime senior vice president at Oracle. Since they founded SambaNova in 2017 it has raised $1.1 billion in investment from backers like Accel, OpenAI and Khosla Ventures and is valued at $5.1 billion.",

Cofounders Alexandr Wang and Lucy Guo had realized humans were vital in labeling the data needed to train the AI used in self-driving cars. Scale capitalized on that boom, setting itself up as a crucial data supplier for generative AI. Nearly a decade later, it works with customers like Meta, Microsoft and OpenAI on labeling training data and building infrastructure for their models. It was last valued at $13.8 billion in May after closing a $1 billion series F funding round backed by Accel, Amazon, Meta and others, cementing Wang's status as one of the world's youngest billionaires at age 28. In March, Scale AI announced a contract with the Department of Defense called Thunderforge to help it use AI for military planning and operations.",

Those include text chats as well as voice agents, who can talk people through flight changes, shopping returns or banking questions. Traction from customers including Sonos and The North Face has helped Taylor and Bavor to raise $285 million from top VC firms Benchmark and Sequoia, reaching a $4.5 billion valuation last fall. In September, the company announced they've raised another $350 million at a valuation of $10 billion, led by Greenoaks.",

Its founders are certainly fluent in entrepreneurship: CEO Connor Zwick previously founded video game company Coco Controller as a Harvard dropout-turned-member of the Thiel Fellowship. That was after starting online learning tool Flashcards+, which education firm Chegg acquired in 2013.

The AI music and sound generation startup has caused a stir since its founding in 2022 by CEO Mikey Shulman\u2014a self-described \u201cformer mediocre musician,\u201d MIT lecturer and former head of machine learning at S&P Global subsidiary Kensho. Suno uses artificial intelligence to let users create full songs with lyrics and background music from basic text-based prompts. In June, major record labels including Sony and Warner sued the startup for allegedly copying thousands of their songs to train its AI models. The music generator has surprisingly admitted its software is trained on all the music files openly available on the internet, arguing that doing so is fair use. But the legal snafu hasn't dampened investors' interest. The Cambridge-based startup has scooped up $125 million in funding from investors like Lightspeed Venture Partners and GitHub CEO Nat Friedman and has grown to around 12 million users. Valued at $500 million, per Pitchbook, Suno integrated with Amazon's Alexa earlier this year.",

        "description": "Elon Musk's artificial intelligence company xAI claims its mission is to \u201cunderstand the true nature of the universe\u201d and \u201caccelerate human scientific discovery.\u201d In late March, the company made a notable acquisition: scooping up X (formerly Twitter) in an all-stock deal that valued the social media platform at $33 billion and the newly merged company at $80 billion. Musk, the world's richest person, owns both entities and said the deal would involve merging their data, models and talent. In June, xAI started building a massive datacenter in Memphis called Colossus that supports a cluster of 100,000 GPUs to train future xAI models. Three months later, part of the supercomputer was online. Not everyone in the city is thrilled about that: Forbes has reported that community members and environment advocates have criticized the speed and secrecy with which the facility was built.",
